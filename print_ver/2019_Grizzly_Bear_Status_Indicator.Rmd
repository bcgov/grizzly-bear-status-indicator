* **Grizzly bears are an important part of the British Columbia landscape.** They play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and are culturally important to  First Nations People living in B.C.


* **For management purposes, grizzly bears are divided into 55 Grizzly Bear Population Units (GBPUs) across B.C.** These units range in size from 2,670 km^2^ to 49,578 km^2^. Managing by local population units allows us to identify local conservation concerns and track grizzly bear abundance and stability. 

* **GBPUs are ranked by conservation concern.** Rankings vary from lowest conservation (M5) to highest conservation concern (M1) using international methods developed by NatureServe^2^ and IUCN. GBPU conservation rankings are determined by three factors; 1) population size and isolation, 2) population trend, and 3) level of threat to bears or bear habitat. An overall level of threat was determined by considering threat level for seven sub-catergories. These include; Agriculture, Biological Use, Climate Change, Energy, Human intrusion, Residential, Transportation. See below for detailed methodology ^1^.  
Ranks are deterined using the latest available data and expert opinion.


### Conservation Concern 

Of the 55 Grizzly Bear Population units (GBPU), three are classed as highest conservation concern (M1) while 11 are conserved of least conservation concern (M5). In general GBPUs located in the southern portion of the province were of higher concern. GBPU units adjacent to the Central Interior unit, in which grizzly bears have been extirpated, were also ranked higher. Refer to Appendices for full dataset.


```{r cons_map, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Conservation Concern Ranking for Grizzly Bear Population units (GBPC)", results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./cons_splot.png")

```


### Population Density Estimate

Grizzly Bear population density ranged from 1 - 27 adults/1000 km^2^. North Selkirk
GBPU had the highest population density.


``` {r pop map, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Grizzly bear population density (adults/1000 km2) per GBPU" , results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center', }

knitr::include_graphics("./pop_splot.png")

```


### Threat Classification

The overall threat for GBPU was assessed from Very High to Negligible. Approximately half of GBPU (23 GBPUs) are in a Low or Negligible overall threat category. The Yahk GBPU, located in the Kooteney-Boundary ranked as Very High threat risk due to XZY.


``` {r threat map, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis', fig.cap = "Grizzly bear overall threat classification", out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./threat_splot.png")

```


Threat classifications are based on three factors; 1) population and isolation, 2) population trend and 3) overall threat. The influence of these three factors on the overall threat rank are show below.  


```{r threat_detail, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Influence of three contributing factors to conservation concern ranking per GBPU. Contributing factors include population trend, population size and isolation and overall threat.", out.width='0.95\\linewidth'}

knitr::include_graphics("./radar_plot.png")

```


## Summary of threats to Grizzly Bears

The overall threat for GBPU was assessed from Very High to Negligible. Approximately half of GBPU (23 GBPUs) are in a Low or Negligible overall threat category. The Yahk GBPU, located in the Kooteney-Boundary was ranked as Very High risk due to XZY.


```{r image-ref-for-in-text, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='0.70\\linewidth'}

knitr::include_graphics("./othreat_plot.png")

```


The largest number of threats was due to Human Intrusion , followed by transportation (road and rail density), energy production and mining, agriculture (livestock density), residential (human density), biological use (mortality), and climate-change (salmon decline).

```{r threat sum plot ,echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='0.70\\linewidth'}

```


## Methods

* Conservation ranks were based on internationally recognized tools developed by NatureServe ^2^. This enabled conservation rankings in line with international standards on species management criteria (NatureServe and international ranking (IUCN). 

* Each GBPU was assigned a rank based on population size and trend, genetic and demograpohic isolation, and overall threat to grizzly bears and bear habitat. Each GBPU starts with a rank of 5 – M5 no conservation concern – this value is reduced based on 1) negative population trend, 2) small and/or isolated population, and 3) overall threat (negligible, low, medium, high & very high) 

* details on population metrics?

* details on trend metrics?

* Threats considered in the analysis were based on IUCN-CMP (Conservation Measures Partnership) classifications of direct threats. Threat categories are based on threat scope and severity. <The NatureServe calculator>[https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/conservation-rank-calculator] was used to combine the individual threats to determine an overall threat category. A full description of threats can be found here. 

* Numeric values generated from the calculator were reviewed by experts to ensure accurate assesment used. 

* Where numeric rankings spanned multiple catergories (i.e. M1M2), a conservative approach was applied with the highest concern catergory used.
