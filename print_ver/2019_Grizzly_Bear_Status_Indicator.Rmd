* **Grizzly bears are an important part of the British Columbia landscape.** 
  + They are a symbol of ecological integrity that represents much of what British Columbians and visitors alike appreciate about B.C.’s natural beauty.
  + B.C. is host to some of North America’s last remaining places where large predators and their prey play out their millennia-old roles. Grizzly bears are a key part of these systems.
  +	They are an important “umbrella” species, as landscapes that support healthy Grizzly bear populations will be able to sustain many other species.
  +	Grizzly bears play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, for example, by distributing salmon nutrients into forests, and transporting seeds through their feces.
  +	They are an important part of the culture of First Nations People living in B.C.
  +	Grizzly bear viewing is an important economic and social components of B.C.’s tourism and recreation industries.


* **For management purposes, grizzly bears are divided into 55 Grizzly Bear Population Units (GBPUs) across B.C.** These units range in size from 2,670 km^2^ to 49,578 km^2^. Managing by local population units allows us to identify local conservation concerns and track grizzly bear abundance and stability. 

* **GBPUs are ranked by conservation concern.** Rankings vary from lowest conservation (M5) to highest conservation concern (M1) using international methods developed by NatureServe^2^ and IUCN. GBPU conservation rankings are determined by three factors; 1) population size and isolation, 2) population trend, and 3) level of threat to bears or bear habitat. An overall level of threat was determined by considering threat level for seven sub-catergories. These include; Residential, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, Biological Use, Human intrusion and Climate Change. See below for detailed methodology ^1^. 

* Grizzly bears are ranked S3 (Vulnerable Uncertain; 2015) in B.C. by the Conservation Data Centre, and are classified as a ‘Species of Concern’ under the federal Species at Risk ACT (SARA; 2018).

* The cumulative effects of human development is the greatest threat to Grizzly bears in B.C. These effects impact bears in three main (often overlapping) ways:
  +	Conflicts between bears and humans increase in frequency, often resulting in bears being killed or relocated;
  + Bear populations become isolated because of human settlements, agriculture, and utility corridors in major valley bottoms;
  +	Habitat may be lost or degraded by development, alienated through bears’ avoidance of humans and human activities, or fragmented—for example, by high density road networks with high traffic volumes.
  
•	Roads are known to have a negative effect on Grizzly bear habitat use when they reach a density of about 0.6 km^REFERENCE^ of road per sq km. This effect gets stronger when road density increases over ~0.75 km/sq km. In addition, new or improved roads bring people into contact with Grizzly bears more frequently, and sometimes those encounters are lethal for bears.

### Conservation Concern 



```{r cons_map, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Conservation Concern Ranking for Grizzly Bear Population units (GBPU)", results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./cons_splot.png")

```


Of the 55 Grizzly Bear Population units (GBPU), three are classed as extreme conservation concern (M1) while 12 are ranked as least conservation concern (M5). In general GBPUs located in the southern portion of the province were of higher concern. GBPU units adjacent to the Central Interior unit, in which grizzly bears have been extirpated, were also ranked higher. Refer to Appendices for full dataset.


\newpage

### Population Density Estimate



``` {r pop map, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Grizzly bear population density (adults/1000 km2) per GBPU" , results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center', }

knitr::include_graphics("./pop_splot.png")

```

Grizzly Bear population density ranged from 1 - 49 adults/1000 km^2^. North Selkirk
GBPU had the highest population density.

\newpage

### Threat Classification



``` {r threat map, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis', fig.cap = "Grizzly bear overall threat classification", out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./threat_splot.png")

```

The overall threat for GBPU was assessed from Very High to Negligible. Approximately half of GBPU (23 GBPUs) are in a Low or Negligible overall threat category. The Yahk GBPU, located in the Kooteney-Boundary ranked as Very High threat risk due to the combinated threats of Agriculture, Human intrusion, Residential, Transportation and Biological Use. 




Threat classifications are based on three factors; 1) population and isolation, 2) population trend and 3) overall threat. The influence of these three factors on the overall threat rank are show below.  


```{r threat_detail, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='0.99\\linewidth'}

knitr::include_graphics("./radar_plot.png")


```


```{r radar_key, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='right', fig.cap = "Influence of three contributing factors to conservation concern ranking per GBPU. Contributing factors include population trend, population size and isolation and overall threat.", out.width='0.30\\linewidth'}

knitr::include_graphics("./radar_plot_key.png")

## Summary of threats to Grizzly Bears



```{r image-ref-for-in-text, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='0.70\\linewidth'}

knitr::include_graphics("./othreat_plot.png")

```

The largest number of threats was due to Human Intrusion , followed by transportation (road and rail density), energy production and mining, agriculture (livestock density), residential (human density), biological use (mortality), and climate-change (salmon decline).

```{r threat sum plot ,echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='0.70\\linewidth'}

## Methods

* Conservation concern ranks were generated using a variation of NatureServe’s‘Element Rank Calculator’^2^. In conjunction with Provincial bear biologists the calculator was modified for application to Grizzly Bear Population Units in British Columbia. This enabled rankings consistent with recognized standards on species ranking criteria (B.C. Conservation Data Centre, NatureServe, and IUCN).


* Each GBPU was assigned a rank based on population size and trend, genetic and demographic isolation, and overall threat to grizzly bears and bear habitat. Each GBPU starts with a rank of 5 – M5 no conservation concern – this value is reduced based on 1) negative population trend, 2) small and/or isolated population, and 3) overall threat (negligible, low, medium, high & very high) 


* Population trend over 3 generations (~30 years) modifies the rank, such that if the population decrease is >25% then the population/risk rank value gets downgraded.

*	Population size and isolation are combined such that smaller isolated population’s rank scores can be reduced by as much as 4 points, whereas large well connected populations are not downgraded.

* •	Threats considered in the ranking were based on IUCN-CMP (Conservation Measures Partnership) classifications of direct threats. Threats were quantified using published spatial data, including Statistics Canada, B.C.’s Baseline Thematic Mapping, Digital Road Atlas, Fish and Wildlife hunter and mortality data and Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ Salmon escapement.  [The NatureServe calculator](https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/conservation-rank-calculator) combined individual threats into  an overall threat class.
